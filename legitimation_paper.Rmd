## The dangers of legitimation

### How the presence of RRPs in Parliament can increase anti-immigration attitudes.

#### Abstract

Are citizens hiding their true preferences? The entry of nativist and nationalist radical right parties can help
normalize certain attitudes considered taboo among the population. This paper argues that the presence of
an RPP in parliament has a legitimation effect that allows citizens to declare their antiimmigration attitudes,
previously hidden. I test this argument using a difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology, examining
whether the population expresses more negative attitudes towards immigration after the entry of Vox, a
Spanish RRP, in the Andalusian Regional Parliament in 2018. Results show a strong positive relationship
between Vox’s entry in parliament and people’s proclivity of expressing negative attitudes towards immigrants
of the Andalusian population immediately after the election, compared to citizens from other regions of
Spain. However, this effect does not hold in the long term. This article has important implications for our
understanding of attitude normalization and RRP effects on society.
